This is a cheep and cheezy little app to test the Bezier Curve formula.

Simply download and open with XCode.  If you don't have a developer license, run in the simulator.

This program is released with the LGPL license.  You can do whatever you want with it, including copy it,
take credit for it, and sell it on the app store, though I'd personally be embarrassed to claim this code as my
own.  No warranty express or implied, and if you turn the planet into grey goo with it, it's not my fault.
